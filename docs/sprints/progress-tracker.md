- Added frontend tenant-aware auth state:
  - active tenant and membership exposure in `useAuth()`
  - tenant refresh and switch actions
  - explicit no-tenant state for authenticated users without memberships
- Added shared tenant switcher UX:
  - single-tenant badge behavior for minimal UI change
  - multi-tenant selector for membership switching
- Added tenant-scoped app remount behavior in [src/App.jsx](../../src/App.jsx) so route trees and shared providers refresh automatically after tenant switching
- Added tenant-scoped React Query isolation in [src/App.jsx](../../src/App.jsx) so cached query results do not carry over between tenants
- Patched key staff and rentee list/dashboard screens to refetch on active-tenant changes and clear stale local state:

  - [src/pages/MaintenanceDetails.jsx](../../src/pages/MaintenanceDetails.jsx)
  - [src/pages/rentee/RenteeMaintenanceDetails.jsx](../../src/pages/rentee/RenteeMaintenanceDetails.jsx)
  - [src/pages/rentee/UtilityHistory.jsx](../../src/pages/rentee/UtilityHistory.jsx)
  - [src/pages/rentee/UtilityReadingForm.jsx](../../src/pages/rentee/UtilityReadingForm.jsx)
- Verified the application still builds successfully after Sprint 05 groundwork changes

  - [src/services/platformClientCore.js](../../src/services/platformClientCore.js)
  - [src/services/fileService.js](../../src/services/fileService.js)
- Added tenant-scoped storage enforcement:
  - authenticated storage writes resolve under `tenants/<tenantId>/...`
  - client storage helpers scope relative paths to the active tenant
  - cross-tenant storage path overrides are blocked
  - legacy non-tenant file reads remain available
- Patched direct/manual upload flows to persist public URLs from tenant-scoped upload paths:
  - [src/services/paymentService.js](../../src/services/paymentService.js)
  - [src/pages/rentee/UtilityReadingForm.jsx](../../src/pages/rentee/UtilityReadingForm.jsx)
  - [src/components/utilities/UtilityMeterForm.jsx](../../src/components/utilities/UtilityMeterForm.jsx)
  - [src/pages/RenteeForm.jsx](../../src/pages/RenteeForm.jsx)
  - [src/services/agreementService.js](../../src/services/agreementService.js)
  - [src/services/eviaSignService.js](../../src/services/eviaSignService.js)
  - [src/services/DocumentService.js](../../src/services/DocumentService.js)
- Added tenant-storage validation tooling:
  - [scripts/validate-tenant-storage.mjs](../../scripts/validate-tenant-storage.mjs)
  - [package.json](../../package.json)
- Added legacy asset migration tooling for tenant-prefixed storage adoption:
  - [scripts/migrate-legacy-storage-assets.mjs](../../scripts/migrate-legacy-storage-assets.mjs)
  - [package.json](../../package.json)
- Added dry-run/apply support for legacy asset URL migration across key tenant-owned tables:
  - `maintenance_request_images.image_url`
  - `utility_readings.photourl`
  - `invoices.paymentproofurl`
  - `agreements.signed_document_url`
  - `agreements.pdfurl`
- Extended legacy asset migration coverage for additional tenant-owned asset fields:
  - `app_users.id_copy_url`
  - `app_users.profile_image_url`
  - `properties.images`
- Extended agreement legacy document/signature coverage for:
  - `agreements.documenturl`
  - `agreements.signeddocumenturl`
  - `agreements.signed_document_url`
  - `agreements.signatureurl`
  - `agreements.signature_pdf_url`
  - `agreements.pdfurl`
- Completed a remaining URL-field audit across the MSSQL repository layer and service workflows:
  - main known tenant-owned persisted storage fields are covered by the migration tool
  - `agreements.documenturl` may still contain inline HTML content in some flows and is therefore only migratable when it contains a real file URL
  - `user_profiles.profile_image_url` remains a legacy frontend reference outside the current MSSQL repository-backed tenant migration scope
- Prevented new inline-HTML `documenturl` writes in [src/components/agreements/AgreementFormContainer.jsx](../../src/components/agreements/AgreementFormContainer.jsx) by keeping HTML in `processedcontent` until a real document file URL is generated
- Improved migration reporting in [scripts/migrate-legacy-storage-assets.mjs](../../scripts/migrate-legacy-storage-assets.mjs) so inline HTML payloads are counted separately as `htmlContent`
- Decided that historical inline-HTML `agreements.documenturl` records will remain compatibility-only:
  - existing records are still viewable because [src/components/agreements/AgreementDocument.jsx](../../src/components/agreements/AgreementDocument.jsx) supports inline HTML rendering
  - new records no longer write inline HTML into `documenturl`
  - the migration script reports these rows but does not attempt file-copy conversion
- Removed the active `user_profiles` dependency from dashboard/profile flows:
  - [src/pages/UserProfile.jsx](../../src/pages/UserProfile.jsx) now uses `app_users`
  - [src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx](../../src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx) now persists preferred language locally
  - [src/hooks/useAuth.jsx](../../src/hooks/useAuth.jsx) now hydrates stored preferred language for the active user
  - [src/utils/userPreferences.js](../../src/utils/userPreferences.js) centralizes local preference storage
- Hardened the migration script so it skips missing local tables or columns gracefully by checking MSSQL metadata before scanning each target
- Validated apply-mode migration locally with temporary seeded fixtures for `app_users` and `properties.images`:
  - legacy `/storage/...` URLs were detected correctly
  - files were copied into `tenants/<tenantId>/...`
  - MSSQL URLs and JSON-backed property image arrays were rewritten successfully
  - temporary validation fixtures were cleaned up after verification
- Validated tenant-scoped storage behavior locally:
  - uploads are written under the active tenant prefix
  - listing resolves the tenant-scoped directory
  - cross-tenant storage path overrides are rejected with `TENANT_STORAGE_OVERRIDE_BLOCKED`
  - scoped delete cleanup succeeds
- Verified the application still builds successfully after Sprint 06 storage groundwork changes
- Revalidated the legacy asset report after the inline-HTML cleanup; `npm run migrate:tenant-storage-assets` still runs successfully
- Verified `user_profiles` no longer appears in active source references under [src](../../src)
- Hardened Docker/public-route auth behavior during local container testing:
  - removed the duplicate global `PropertyProvider` mount so property bootstrap does not run twice
  - updated [src/contexts/PropertyContext.jsx](../../src/contexts/PropertyContext.jsx) to defer protected property loading until auth has finished and a tenant-backed user context exists
  - routed MSSQL property reads through the shared request-context client so Docker browser sessions send `x-auth-id`, `x-user-email`, and `x-tenant-id` headers consistently
- Hardened Docker dev-bypass behavior for local testing:
  - added client request propagation for a local-only `x-dev-bypass-role` header when no real auth session exists
  - updated [src/api/tenant/context.js](../../src/api/tenant/context.js) to resolve a synthetic local user plus fallback tenant when dev bypass is explicitly enabled
  - short-circuited unauthenticated app-user list fetches in [src/services/appUserRepository.js](../../src/services/appUserRepository.js) so public routes do not spam `/api/mssql/app-users`
  - removed the module-load utility schema probe in [src/services/utilityBillingService.js](../../src/services/utilityBillingService.js) so login/public routes do not trigger background platform RPCs
- Hardened Docker compatibility mode for partial local schemas:
  - updated [src/api/platform/router.js](../../src/api/platform/router.js) so `select` queries against missing MSSQL tables or columns return empty compatibility results instead of surfacing a 500 during local dashboard testing
- Hardened Docker agreement compatibility for sparse local schemas:
  - updated [src/pages/AgreementList.jsx](../../src/pages/AgreementList.jsx) and [src/hooks/useAgreement.js](../../src/hooks/useAgreement.js) to use the shared MSSQL request client so agreement reads include auth and tenant headers
  - updated [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js) so missing `agreement_templates` tables return controlled compatibility responses instead of raw 500s
  - extended [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js) so missing `agreements` schema also returns controlled empty/read-not-found responses instead of surfacing 500s during local Docker testing
  - updated [src/services/agreementService.js](../../src/services/agreementService.js) so template operations stop cascading into a second failing platform write when the local schema does not include `agreement_templates`
- Added a local MSSQL agreement-template schema migration for Docker test environments:
  - [src/db/migrations/20260317_03_create_agreement_templates.sql](../../src/db/migrations/20260317_03_create_agreement_templates.sql)
- Executed the local Docker agreement-template migration against `khrental-mssql` and verified the template create flow succeeds again through `/api/mssql/agreement-templates`
- Added a local MSSQL agreement workflow schema migration for Docker test environments:
  - [src/db/migrations/20260318_01_create_local_agreement_workflow_schema.sql](../../src/db/migrations/20260318_01_create_local_agreement_workflow_schema.sql)
- Executed the local Docker agreement workflow migration against `khrental-mssql` and verified these list endpoints now read real MSSQL tables without 500s:
  - `/api/mssql/agreements`
  - `/api/mssql/property-units`
  - `/api/mssql/invoices`
- Seeded minimal local agreement test data in Docker MSSQL for interactive verification:
  - one apartment property
  - one unit under that property
  - one rentee user
- Validated the live Docker agreement persistence path end-to-end:
  - agreement create via `/api/mssql/agreements` succeeds
  - agreement update via `/api/mssql/agreements/:id` now persists `title`, `terms`, and `notes`
  - agreement fetch via `/api/mssql/agreements/:id` returns the updated joined agreement payload without server errors
- Decoupled local dev-bypass tooling from `NODE_ENV` so Docker can keep serving the production bundle while still exposing local test shortcuts when `VITE_ENABLE_DEV_BYPASS=true`:
  - added `VITE_ENABLE_DEV_BYPASS` to generated browser env config
  - updated auth/login dev-bypass checks to use the explicit runtime flag instead of `process.env.NODE_ENV`
  - enabled the flag by default in [docker-compose.yml](../../docker-compose.yml) for local container testing
- Added a local MSSQL properties schema augmentation migration for Docker test environments:
  - [src/db/migrations/20260319_01_augment_local_properties_schema.sql](../../src/db/migrations/20260319_01_augment_local_properties_schema.sql)
- Executed the local Docker properties schema migration against `khrental-mssql` and verified `/api/platform/query` now returns rich property rows without 500s when selecting legacy UI fields including:
  - `unitconfiguration`
  - `checklistitems`
  - `description`
  - `squarefeet`
  - `yearbuilt`
  - `availablefrom`
  - `amenities`
  - `electricity_rate`
  - `water_rate`
- Added a local MSSQL property coordinates migration for Docker test environments:
  - [src/db/migrations/20260319_02_add_property_coordinates.sql](../../src/db/migrations/20260319_02_add_property_coordinates.sql)
- Hardened local Docker dev-bypass compatibility for non-GUID identity values:
  - [src/api/mssql/repositories.js](../../src/api/mssql/repositories.js) now returns controlled null results when `app_users/:id` style routes receive a non-`uniqueidentifier` id
  - [src/api/platform/router.js](../../src/api/platform/router.js) now degrades invalid `uniqueidentifier` filters in generic platform select/update/delete/upsert operations to empty compatibility results instead of surfacing a 500
  - [src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestForm.jsx](../../src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestForm.jsx), [src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestList.jsx](../../src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestList.jsx), and [src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestDetails.jsx](../../src/components/maintenance/MaintenanceRequestDetails.jsx) no longer pass dev-bypass auth ids where `app_users.id` values are required
- Started Sprint 09 backend foundation for tenant administration:
  - [src/api/mssql/repositories.js](../../src/api/mssql/repositories.js) now exposes admin-oriented tenant list, get, create, and update helpers with `tenant_settings` hydration
  - [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js) now exposes admin-only tenant CRUD endpoints under `/api/mssql/admin/tenants`
  - [src/api/mssql/repositories.js](../../src/api/mssql/repositories.js) now exposes tenant membership list, create, update, and delete helpers with default-tenant synchronization back into `app_users.tenant_id`
  - [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js) now exposes admin-only tenant membership endpoints under `/api/mssql/admin/tenants/:tenantId/memberships`
  - [src/api/mssql/repositories.js](../../src/api/mssql/repositories.js) now filters `app_users` create/update payloads against the actual local MSSQL column set, generates ids when the table has no default constraint, and normalizes missing compatibility fields so reduced local schemas no longer 500 on user create/update routes
  - [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js) now exposes an admin-only global app-user listing route under `/api/mssql/admin/app-users` so tenant membership assignment can search existing app users without tenant scoping conflicts
  - [src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx](../../src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx), [src/services/tenantAdminService.js](../../src/services/tenantAdminService.js), [src/routes.jsx](../../src/routes.jsx), and [src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx](../../src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx) now add the first platform-admin tenant management UI for tenant CRUD and membership assignment under `/dashboard/tenant-admin`
  - [src/api/mssql/router.js](../../src/api/mssql/router.js), [src/services/tenantAdminService.js](../../src/services/tenantAdminService.js), and [src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx](../../src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx) now support admin-side app-user creation inside the tenant admin flow, so clean local Docker databases no longer need pre-seeded users before membership assignment can begin
- Started a first-pass UI design-system cleanup for the most visible shared surfaces:
  - [src/index.css](../../src/index.css) now defines one consistent set of design tokens, page/panel/auth utility classes, and removes conflicting scaffold-era global styles that were fighting page-level layouts
  - [src/App.css](../../src/App.css) no longer injects the old Vite demo layout constraints into the live application shell
  - [src/components/ui/Button.jsx](../../src/components/ui/Button.jsx), [src/components/ui/FormInput.jsx](../../src/components/ui/FormInput.jsx), and [src/components/ui/FormSelect.jsx](../../src/components/ui/FormSelect.jsx) now align to the shared brand styling instead of older ad hoc control treatments
  - [src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx](../../src/components/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx) now uses the same brand shell, navigation states, and surface treatment as the new admin work instead of a separate legacy sidebar visual language
  - [src/pages/Login.jsx](../../src/pages/Login.jsx), [src/pages/Settings.jsx](../../src/pages/Settings.jsx), and [src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx](../../src/pages/TenantAdmin.jsx) now share the same page hero, panel, and control vocabulary

### In Progress
- Sprint 06 tenant-scoped storage
- Sprint 09 tenant admin backend foundation
- Sprint 09 tenant admin UI
- Shared UI design-system consolidation across remaining legacy pages
- Broad manual regression coverage is still needed across tenant-switch and tenant-storage flows
- Legacy asset migration still needs execution against richer real-world data before Sprint 06 can close

### Blockers / Notes
- The current local Docker database is still a partial baseline and may still be missing other legacy application tables outside the core agreement workflow path
- Direct CLI execution of some frontend service modules is still awkward under raw local Node because parts of the app rely on bundler-resolved extensionless imports; runtime verification should prefer the live Docker app/API path unless those imports are normalized
- Because those tables are absent locally, tenant backfill coverage for legacy rows and seed memberships could not be fully exercised in this validation pass
- Temporary local `app_users` rows and memberships were created only for endpoint validation and cleaned up afterward
- The reduced local `app_users` schema still does not persist `status` or `active`; the API now ignores those unsupported writes and returns compatibility defaults instead of surfacing 500s
- Broader end-to-end validation for property, invoice, and agreement scoping still needs a richer local schema snapshot and sample data
- Any legitimate admin or operational raw-SQL workflows will need a clearly separate non-runtime path rather than the generic authenticated platform API
- Some legacy pages may still have local state assumptions that need targeted regression checks after tenant switching
- Legacy uploaded assets now have migration tooling, but current compatibility still relies on preserved read paths until the script is run against real data
- Some agreement records may still store inline HTML in `documenturl`, but this is now an accepted compatibility-only case rather than an open migration blocker
- UI consistency is improved at the shared shell/login/settings/tenant-admin layer, but other legacy pages still need migration onto the same card, form, and navigation primitives before the app will feel fully unified

### Next Steps
- Run browser-based validation on the new `/dashboard/tenant-admin` screen, especially create-user then create-membership flows and current-user membership edits that change tenant-switch behavior.
- Extend the new design-system pass to remaining high-traffic legacy screens such as `AdminDashboard`, property forms, and rentee-facing entry points.
- Confirm the permission model for platform-admin tenant actions versus tenant-scoped admin settings.
- Decide whether Google and Microsoft sign-in should be mandatory for production rollout or introduced behind a staged feature flag.
- Define the provider callback and redirect strategy for both local Docker and hosted environments before frontend auth work begins.
1. Run the legacy asset migration tooling against richer data and verify copied files plus updated MSSQL references
2. Add broader negative validation for cross-tenant property, invoice, agreement, and storage access in richer multi-tenant data scenarios
3. Import a richer local schema snapshot for deeper end-to-end multi-tenant verification
4. Run full tenant-storage migration and regression checks against richer real-world data
