The system follows a modular architecture that separates concerns between data, business logic, and presentation layers.

## Data Model

### Core Entities

#### Properties
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "string",
  address: "string",
  electricity_rate: "numeric",
  water_rate: "numeric",
  bank_name: "string",

  propertyid: "uuid",
  unitid: "uuid",
  status: "string",

  enddate: "date"
}
```

#### Utility Readings

}
```

### Relationships

1. **Property to Units**: One-to-many relationship
2. **Property to Agreements**: One-to-many relationship
3. **Rentee to Agreements**: One-to-many relationship
4. **Property to Utility Readings**: One-to-many relationship
5. **Property to Invoices**: One-to-many relationship
6. **Utility Readings to Invoices**: Many-to-one relationship

## Service Layer

### invoiceService.js

The invoice service handles all invoice-related operations with specific functions for multi-property management:

```javascript
/**
 * Fetch utility readings ready for invoicing, grouped by property and rentee
 * @param {Array|string} propertyIds - Property IDs to filter by (array or single ID)
 * @param {Object} options - Additional filter options
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Grouped readings with property and rentee info
 */
export const fetchReadingsForInvoiceByProperty = async (propertyIds, options = {}) => {
  // Implementation details
};

/**
 * Generate invoices from utility readings for multiple properties
 * @param {Object} readingsByProperty - Readings grouped by property and rentee
 * @param {Object} options - Additional options for invoice generation
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Generated invoices with status
 */
export const generateInvoicesByProperty = async (readingsByProperty, options = {}) => {
  // Implementation details
};

/**
 * Get invoice summary metrics grouped by property
 * @param {Array|string} propertyIds - Property IDs to include (optional)
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Summary metrics by property
 */
export const getInvoiceSummaryByProperty = async (propertyIds) => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

### propertyService.js

Extended to support multi-property operations:

```javascript
/**
 * Get properties with pending utility readings ready for invoicing
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Properties with pending reading counts
 */
export const getPropertiesWithPendingReadings = async () => {
  // Implementation details
};

/**
 * Get property access information for staff member
 * @param {string} staffId - Staff user ID
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Property access details
 */
export const getStaffPropertyAccess = async (staffId) => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

### utilityBillingService.js

Extended to support invoice-related operations:

```javascript
/**
 * Mark utility readings as included in invoice
 * @param {Array} readingIds - Reading IDs to update
 * @param {string} invoiceId - Invoice ID
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Result of update operation
 */
export const markReadingsAsInvoiced = async (readingIds, invoiceId) => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

## UI Components

### PropertyContext Provider

```jsx
// src/contexts/PropertyContext.jsx
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect, useContext } from 'react';

// Context definition and provider implementation
export const PropertyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // State and methods implementation
};

// Custom hook for using the context
export const useProperty = () => useContext(PropertyContext);
```

### Key Components

1. **PropertySelector**
   - Allows staff to select one or multiple properties
   - Remembers recent selections
   - Supports property search

2. **InvoiceManagementDashboard**
   - Main dashboard for staff to manage invoices
   - Property-grouped invoice summary
   - Action buttons for batch operations

3. **InvoiceGenerationWizard**
   - Step-by-step flow for creating invoices
   - Property grouping for readings
   - Preview and confirmation steps

4. **InvoiceTable**
   - Displays invoices with property context
   - Supports filtering and sorting
   - Action buttons for invoice operations

## User Workflows

### Invoice Generation Workflow

    A[Access Dashboard] --> B[Select Properties]
    B --> C[View Pending Readings]
    C --> D[Generate Invoices]
    D --> E[Preview Invoice Items]
    E --> F[Confirm and Create]
    F --> G[Send Notifications]
```

### Invoice Management Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[View Invoices] --> B[Filter by Property]
    B --> C[Select Invoices]
    C --> D[Process Selected Invoices]
    D --> E[Mark as Paid/Void]
    D --> F[Send Reminders]
    D --> G[Download Reports]
```

## Property-Rentee Relationship Management

The system carefully maintains the integrity of property-rentee relationships:

1. **Validation Layer**
   - Ensures rentees are associated with properties via agreements
   - Verifies unit assignments within properties
   - Maintains utility reading association with correct property

2. **Invoice Grouping Logic**
   - Groups utility readings by property and rentee
   - Ensures readings for different properties are kept separate
   - Aggregates readings for the same rentee within a property

3. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - Validates that all readings in an invoice belong to the same property-rentee pair
   - Prevents cross-property data mixing
   - Maintains audit trail of property associations

## Security and Authorization

### Staff Property Access Control

```javascript
// Staff user access levels in app_users table
{
  "property_access": {
    "access_type": "limited", // all, group, limited
    "property_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2"], // Directly accessible properties
    "property_group_ids": ["group1"] // Property groups accessible
  }
}
```

### Authorization Rules

1. Staff can only view and manage properties they have access to
2. Global admin users have access to all properties
3. Property-specific staff can only access assigned properties
4. Property access is enforced at both service and UI levels

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

1. **Service Layer Errors**
   - Detailed error messages with property context
   - Transaction-based operations to ensure consistency
   - Rollback mechanisms for multi-property operations

2. **UI Error Boundaries**
   - Property-specific error displays
   - Graceful degradation for partial failures
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations

3. **Error Logging**
   - Property and operation context in logs
   - Structured error data for analysis
   - Alert mechanisms for critical errors
