- `useAuth` - Authentication and user information
- `usePermissions` - Permission checking
- Feature-specific custom hooks

### `/src/utils`
Utility functions and helper methods:
- Date and time formatting
- Data validation
- Helper functions

### `/src/services`
Service modules for interacting with backend APIs:
- `platformClient.js` - Shared client wrapper for the backend platform API
- `agreementService.js` - Agreement operations
- `eviaSignService.js` - Evia Sign integration
- `fileService.js` - File upload and management
- `maintenanceService.js` - Maintenance request operations
- Other service modules

## Services

### Platform Integration (`platformClient.js`)
- Authentication
- Database operations
- File storage
- Real-time subscriptions

### Document Management
- `DocumentService.js` - Document generation and processing
- `eviaSignService.js` - Digital signature integration

### Data Services
- Property management
- Rentee management

## Authentication and Authorization

The application uses the local platform auth compatibility layer and a custom role-based permission system:

### User Roles
- `admin` - Full system access
- `staff` - General staff access
- `maintenance_staff` - Focused on maintenance tasks
- `finance_staff` - Focused on financial tasks
- `rentee` - Tenant access to personal information and services

### Permission System
- Feature-based permissions
- Role-based access control
- Page-level protection with ProtectedRoute component

## API Integration

### Evia Sign Integration
The system integrates with Evia Sign for digital signatures:
- OAuth authentication
- Document signing workflow
- Webhook integration for status updates
- Signed document retrieval

### Webhook Processing
- Webhook events from Evia Sign are processed
- Agreement statuses are updated based on signature events
- Designed for reliability with database triggers
- Currently implemented via a dedicated Azure webhook server at kh-reantals-webhook.azurewebsites.net

## Database Structure

The application uses the application database with the following main tables:

- `properties` - Property information
- `units` - Individual rental units within properties
- `rentees` - Tenant information
- `agreements` - Rental agreements
- `agreement_templates` - Templates for agreements
- `maintenance_requests` - Maintenance tickets
- `invoices` - Billing invoices
- `utility_readings` - Utility consumption data
- `webhook_events` - Webhook event tracking
- `app_users` - Application user profiles

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Azure Web App:

### Azure Configuration
- Environment variables must be set in Azure App Settings
- Web.config is configured for client-side routing
- Azure deployment is handled via GitHub Actions

### Environment Variables
Ensure these variables are configured in production:
- `VITE_API_ENDPOINT`
- `VITE_EVIA_SIGN_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_EVIA_SIGN_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `VITE_API_ENDPOINT`
- `VITE_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify the API endpoint and server configuration are correct
   - Check user permissions in the application database and auth records
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set

2. **Webhook Processing**
   - Ensure the webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Check database triggers for webhook_events
   - Verify Evia Sign configuration

3. **Document Generation**
   - Check templates in the database
   - Verify HTML processing is working correctly
   - Ensure proper content encoding

4. **URL Handling**
   - Ensure proper URL encoding for paths containing HTML content
   - Check env-config.js for proper URL handling

## Modules for Potential Refactoring

During analysis, the following modules were identified for potential refactoring:

1. **api-server.js** - This standalone Express server appears to be redundant since the application is now using a dedicated webhook server at kh-reantals-webhook.azurewebsites.net.

2. **Multiple Webhook Implementation Files** - There are numerous webhook implementation files in the /docs directory that could be consolidated:
   - webhook-implementation-guide.md
   - webhook-setup.md
   - evia-webhook-workflow.md
   - evia-webhook-setup.md
   - evia-webhook-solution.md
   - evia-webhook-integration.md

3. **Legacy Files**:
   - `fileUploadTest.js` appears to be a testing utility rather than a production service
   - `src/scripts/createWebhookEventsTable.sql` may be redundant if the table is already created

4. **Overlapping Services**:
   - Some functionality in `DocumentService.js` and `eviaSignService.js` appears to be overlapping
   - Consider consolidating related functionality

5. **Documentation Consolidation**:
   - Multiple markdown files scattered throughout the project
   - Consider consolidating all documentation into the /documentation directory

## Conclusion

The KH Rentals Management System provides a comprehensive solution for property management with a focus on digital workflows and tenant self-service. The modular architecture allows for easy maintenance and future expansion.
