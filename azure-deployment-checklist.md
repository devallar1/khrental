  - [ ] App location: `/`
  - [ ] API location: `api`
  - [ ] Output location: `dist`
- [ ] Save and wait for initial deployment
- [ ] Copy deployment token to GitHub Secrets as `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN`
- [ ] Check deployment status in GitHub Actions

## Azure App Service (Webhook Server)

- [ ] Create new App Service in Azure Portal
- [ ] Choose Node.js 22 as runtime stack
- [ ] Choose Linux as operating system
- [ ] Choose appropriate region (same as Static Web App)
- [ ] Create or select App Service Plan
- [ ] Configure deployment settings:
  - [ ] Deployment Center > GitHub
  - [ ] Choose your organization and repository
  - [ ] Choose branch (main)
- [ ] Configure application settings:
  - [ ] `PORT`: 8080
  - [ ] SQL Server connection settings for the active environment
  - [ ] `EVIA_SIGN_WEBHOOK_URL`: Your webhook endpoint
- [ ] Configure startup command:
  - [ ] `cd webhook-server && node server.js`

## Evia Sign Configuration

- [ ] Update Evia Sign webhook URL to point to Azure App Service
  - [ ] `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/webhook/evia-sign`
- [ ] Test webhook connection from Evia Sign dashboard

## Testing After Deployment

### Main Application
- [ ] Visit your Static Web App URL
- [ ] Test login functionality
- [ ] Test creating new agreements
- [ ] Test viewing invoices

### Webhook Server
- [ ] Visit `https://your-app-name.azurewebsites.net/status`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check application logs in Azure Portal
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow runs
3. Verify environment variables in Azure App Service
4. Test webhook server locally before deployment
5. Check SQL Server and application logs for database errors
