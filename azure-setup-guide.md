2. In the left menu, find **Get publish profile** and click it
3. This will download a file - open it in a text editor

2. Choose **GitHub** as the source
3. Authenticate with GitHub and select your repository and branch (main)
4. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the build provider
5. Your workflow will use the `.github/workflows/main-app-deploy.yml` file

## 4. Setting Up Client-Side Routing

1. Make sure the `web.config` file is in the root of your repository
2. This file contains the URL rewrite rules necessary for React Router to work correctly

## 5. Testing the Deployment

1. Push a change to your GitHub repository
2. Go to your GitHub repository's **Actions** tab to see the workflow run
3. Once the workflow completes, visit khrentals.kubeira.com to verify your app is working
4. Test the key features of your application, including:
   - Login functionality
   - Routing (navigate to different pages)
   - API integration
   - Evia Sign integration

## 6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Setting Up Monitoring

3. Set up alerts for key metrics like response time and failure rate

### Viewing Logs

1. Go to **Monitoring > Log Stream** to view real-time logs
2. Check **Deployment Center > Logs** to see deployment-specific logs
3. Use **Advanced Tools (Kudu)** for more detailed diagnostics:
   - Go to **Advanced Tools** and click **Go**
   - Navigate to **Debug console > PowerShell**
   - Browse to site/wwwroot to see your deployed files

## 7. Scaling Your Web App
