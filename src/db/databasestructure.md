## Utility Readings Status Flow

The utility readings table has constraints that control the allowed values for `status` and `billing_status` columns.

### Status Column Constraint

The `status` column has a constraint that restricts values to:

```sql
ALTER TABLE utility_readings
ADD CONSTRAINT utility_readings_status_check
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'verified', 'billed', 'disputed', 'approved', 'completed', 'rejected', 'cancelled'));
```

This constraint ensures that utility readings can only have a valid workflow status. The status values represent:

- `pending`: Initial status when a reading is submitted but not yet reviewed
- `approved`: Reading has been reviewed and approved by staff
- `completed`: Reading has been processed and is ready for invoicing
- `verified`: Reading has been verified for accuracy
- `rejected`: Reading was rejected by staff (e.g., incorrect values)
- `cancelled`: Reading was cancelled and will not be processed
- `billed`: Reading has been billed to the customer
- `disputed`: Reading has been disputed by the customer

### Billing Status Column Constraint

The `billing_status` column has a separate constraint that restricts values to:

```sql
ALTER TABLE utility_readings
ADD CONSTRAINT utility_readings_billing_status_check
CHECK (billing_status IN ('pending', 'pending_invoice', 'invoiced', 'rejected') OR billing_status IS NULL);
```

The billing status tracks the invoicing process for the utility reading:

- `NULL`: No billing action has been taken yet
- `pending`: Initial status when a reading is first approved for billing
- `pending_invoice`: Reading has been processed and is ready to be included in an invoice
- `invoiced`: Reading has been included in an invoice
- `rejected`: Reading was rejected and will not be invoiced

### Effective Status Tracking

Due to database constraints, the application uses a combination of fields to track the effective status:

1. The `status` column holds the overall status
2. The `billing_status` column tracks billing-specific status
3. The `billing_data` JSON field contains an `effective_status` property that may override display status
4. Additional timestamp fields (approved_date, rejected_date, invoiced_date) provide audit trail

This approach allows the system to display the correct status to users while maintaining database constraints and providing detailed information about the utility reading's progress through the workflow.
